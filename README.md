# Homework Three - Promises, Async, & Await

## Promises Assignment:https://in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu/~zadomin/N320/homework-three/promises/promises.html

## Async/Await Assignment: https://in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu/~zadomin/N320/homework-three/async-await/async.html

In this assignment, we had to test our knowledge with Promises, as well as understand the way asynchronous functions worked, with the await component implemented.

The first assignment was a promise example, displaying 20 different quotes. If there was an error fetching the quotes, there is an error thrown in the console, with feedback given to the users in the document.

The second assignment was to use our knowledge with async functions and await, and display 20 random pictures of dogs. Similarly to the first assignment, if there was an error, it would display an error in the console, and have feedback in the document.
